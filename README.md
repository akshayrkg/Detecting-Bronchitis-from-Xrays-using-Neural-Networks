# Detecting-Bronchitis-from-Xrays-using-Neural-Networks

Implemented Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning to classify abnormal lungs by looking at a patient's lung X-ray and thus detecting Bronchitis. 


Used Pre-trained Alexnet architecture and fine-tuned it to perform on the X-ray dataset.
